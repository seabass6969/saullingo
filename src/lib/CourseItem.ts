This first lesson is on SOV and sentence structure.<br>SOV stands for Subject, Object, Verb and tells you in what order the sentence is written. In english we use SVO for example “I ate the apple” however in <ipa>hɛɾɪnəʊ</ipa> you would write “ate I the apple” as this is in VSO the order that <ipa>hɛɾɪnəʊ</ipa> uses.<br>When writing sentences in this order, split them into phrases, for example “I like eating bread and I like eating toast” is “like eating I bread and like eating I toast”. This sentence also shows that when using two verbs next to one another they both go at the beginning of the phrase.<br>One more thing to note <ipa>hɛɾɪnəʊ</ipa> has no words for “a” or “the” so make sure not to type these!<br>"}
